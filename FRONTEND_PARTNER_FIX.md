# Frontend Partner Profile Fix

## Problem
The frontend was still loading partner profiles from **localStorage** instead of the database, so even though the backend was working correctly, the frontend wasn't using the database partner profile.

## What Was Fixed

### Updated ProfileContext.js

1. **loadPartnerProfile()** - Now fetches from `/api/partner` instead of localStorage
2. **setPartnerProfileData()** - Now saves to database via `/api/partner` POST endpoint
3. **Removed localStorage-only logic** - Database is now the primary source

### New Flow:
1. **On app load**: Frontend fetches partner profile from database
2. **When setting partner**: Frontend saves to database + localStorage (for offline)
3. **Chat requests**: Backend automatically loads partner from database
4. **Combined interests**: Now includes both user + database partner interests

## How to Test

### 1. Restart Frontend
```bash
cd dating-agent-frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Open Browser Console (F12)
You should see:
```
🔍 Attempting to load partner profile from database...
💕 Loaded partner profile from database: {name: "Christine", interests: ["music", "dancing", "fitness", "art"], age: 28}
```

### 3. Send a Chat Message
The AI should now respond with suggestions that include both:
- **Your interests**: cats, anime, lifting weights, foodie stuff
- **Christine's interests**: music, dancing, fitness, art

### 4. Check Backend Logs
Should see:
```
🎯 ========== INTERESTS DEBUG ==========
🎯 Backend user interests: ["I love cats", "anime", "lifting weights", "foodie stuff."]
🎯 Backend partner interests: ["music", "dancing", "fitness", "art"]
🎯 Backend combined interests: ["I love cats", "anime", "lifting weights", "foodie stuff.", "music", "dancing", "fitness", "art"]
🎯 ======================================
```

## Expected AI Responses

The AI should now suggest activities that combine both interests:
- **Dance classes** (Christine's dancing + your fitness)
- **Live music venues** (Christine's music interest)
- **Fitness activities** (both your lifting + Christine's fitness)
- **Food experiences** (your foodie interest)
- **Art galleries** (Christine's art interest)

## Files Modified

- ✅ `dating-agent-frontend/src/contexts/ProfileContext.js` - Now uses database API
- ✅ `dating-agent-frontend/src/config.js` - Added Partner API endpoints

## Summary

The frontend now:
1. ✅ Loads partner profile from database on startup
2. ✅ Saves partner profiles to database when created/updated
3. ✅ Falls back to localStorage if database is unavailable
4. ✅ Works seamlessly with the backend's combined interests logic

**Result**: Combined interests now work end-to-end! 🎉
