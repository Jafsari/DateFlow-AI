# Email Setup Guide for AI Dating Assistant

## Current Status
âœ… **Email verification is working with a manual verification system for development**

The app currently uses a manual email verification endpoint that allows you to verify emails without needing to configure SMTP settings.

2. **Redirected** to the email verification page automatically
3. **Enter your email** and click "Verify Email"
4. **Login** with your verified account

## To Enable Real Email Sending (Optional)

If you want to send actual emails, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Gmail Setup (Recommended for Development)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate a password for "Mail"
3. **Update your `.env` file**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Option 2: Other Email Services

Update the email service configuration in `dating-agent-backend/services/emailService.js`:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'your-service', // e.g., 'outlook', 'yahoo', 'hotmail'
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
  }
});
```

### Option 3: Custom SMTP

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'your-smtp-host',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
  }
});
```

## Current Features
