# STT (Speech-to-Text) Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Your STT wasn't working because of a **path mismatch** between frontend and backend.

### The Issue:
- **Backend** (server.js line 41): Routes registered at `/api/chat`
  - So transcribe endpoint is: `http://localhost:5001/api/chat/transcribe`
  
- **Frontend** (config.js line 13): Endpoint was: `/chat/transcribe`
  - Was trying to reach: `http://localhost:5001/chat/transcribe` ❌
  - Missing the `/api` prefix!

This meant every STT request was going to a **non-existent endpoint** and returning 404.

## What Was Fixed

### Fixed Frontend Config
**File:** `dating-agent-frontend/src/config.js`

Added `/api` prefix to ALL endpoints:

**Before:**
```javascript
TRANSCRIBE: `${API_BASE_URL}/chat/transcribe`,
SYNTHESIZE: `${API_BASE_URL}/chat/synthesize`,
// etc...
```

**After:**
```javascript
TRANSCRIBE: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/chat/transcribe`,
SYNTHESIZE: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/chat/synthesize`,
// etc...
```

Also added the new Partner API endpoints to the config.

## How STT Works

1. **User clicks microphone button** in frontend
2. **Browser records audio** using MediaRecorder API
3. **Audio blob sent to backend** via POST to `/api/chat/transcribe`
4. **Backend forwards to Deepgram** using the API key
5. **Deepgram returns transcript**
6. **Text appears in chat input**

## Backend Verification

✅ **Deepgram API Key**: Confirmed present in `.env`
✅ **Transcribe Endpoint**: Exists at `router.post('/transcribe', ...)` in chat.js (line 2888)
✅ **Routes Registered**: `/api/chat` prefix correctly set in server.js
✅ **Authentication**: Uses `authenticateToken` middleware

## Testing

### Option 1: Browser Test (Best)
1. Restart your frontend:
   ```bash
   cd dating-agent-frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. Open the app, login, and click the microphone button
3. Speak something
4. Should see transcription appear in the input field

5. Check browser console (F12) for logs:
   ```
   🎤 Sending audio to Deepgram for transcription...
   ✅ Transcription successful: [your speech]
   ```

### Option 2: Backend Test Script
```bash
cd /Users/justinafsari/Desktop/Dating-Agent
node test-stt.js
```

This will verify:
- Backend server is reachable
- Authentication works
- Transcribe endpoint exists
- Proper error messages

## Troubleshooting

If STT still doesn't work after config fix:

### 1. Check Microphone Permissions
- Browser should prompt for microphone access
- Check browser settings: `chrome://settings/content/microphone`

### 2. Check Browser Console
Look for errors like:
- `NotAllowedError` - User denied microphone permission
- `404` - Path still wrong (clear cache and refresh)
- `NetworkError` - Backend not running

### 3. Check Backend Logs
Should see:
```
🎤 Received audio file: audio.webm Size: [size] bytes
🎤 Transcribing audio with Deepgram...
✅ Transcription successful: [text]
```

If you see:
```
❌ Deepgram transcription error: [error]
```
Then check Deepgram API key or audio format.

### 4. Verify Audio Recording
In frontend, check these logs:
```javascript
console.log('🎤 Audio blob type:', audioBlob.type);
console.log('🎤 Audio blob size:', audioBlob.size, 'bytes');
```

Audio blob should be:
- Type: `audio/webm` or `audio/wav`
- Size: > 0 bytes (if 0, microphone isn't working)

## Files Modified

- ✅ `dating-agent-frontend/src/config.js` - Added `/api` prefix to all endpoints
- ✅ `test-stt.js` - **NEW** - Test script for STT endpoint

## Summary

The STT issue was a simple **configuration bug** - the frontend was calling the wrong URL path. Now:

1. ✅ All API endpoints have correct `/api` prefix
2. ✅ STT endpoint paths match between frontend and backend
3. ✅ Deepgram API key is configured
4. ✅ Backend transcribe route is properly set up

**Next Steps:**
1. Restart your frontend (`npm start`)
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Try the microphone button
4. Should work now! 🎤✨

If you still have issues, check:
- Is backend running on port 5001?
- Did you grant microphone permissions?
- Check browser console and backend logs for specific errors
