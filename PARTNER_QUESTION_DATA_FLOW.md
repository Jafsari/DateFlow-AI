# Partner Question Data Flow Analysis

## Scenario: User asks "What do you know about Christine?"

### Current Data Flow ‚úÖ

1. **Frontend Request**
   - User types: "What do you know about Christine?"
   - Frontend sends POST to `/api/chat` with message and session_id

2. **Backend Processing**
   - `getProfilesForEndpoint()` loads both user and partner profiles from database
   - `buildContext()` creates context object with:
     ```javascript
     {
       userProfile: { name: "Justin", interests: ["cats", "anime", "lifting", "foodie"] },
       partnerProfile: { 
         name: "Christine", 
         age: 28, 
         interests: ["music", "dancing", "fitness", "art"],
         location: "New York, NY",
         bio: "Loves electronic music and nightlife"
       },
       currentEvents: [...],
       currentConversation: { messages: [...] },
       recentContext: [...]
     }
     ```

3. **AI Context Building**
   - `callGroqAPI()` formats context for AI:
     ```
     PARTNER (70% weight): Christine, interests: music, dancing, fitness
     USER (30% weight): New York, interests: cats, anime
     ```

4. **AI Response**
   - AI receives full partner profile context
   - Can answer questions about Christine's interests, age, location, etc.

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 1: Privacy Concerns**
**Problem:** AI might share too much personal info about partner
**Solution:** Add privacy filters to limit what's shared

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 2: Partner Profile Missing**
**Problem:** If no partner profile exists, AI can't answer
**Current Handling:** AI will say "I don't have information about a partner"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 3: Outdated Information**
**Problem:** Partner profile might be stale
**Current Handling:** Frontend loads fresh data from database on each request

## Recommendations

### 1. **Add Privacy Controls**
```javascript
// In buildContext(), filter sensitive info
const safePartnerProfile = {
  name: partnerProfile.name,
  interests: partnerProfile.interests,
  // Don't include: age, location, bio, lifestyle details
};
```

### 2. **Add Partner Profile Validation**
```javascript
// Check if partner profile is complete
if (!partnerProfile || !partnerProfile.name) {
  return "I don't have information about your partner. Please add a partner profile first.";
}
```

### 3. **Enhance AI Prompt**
```javascript
const fionaPrompt = `You are DateFlow AI. 

When asked about the partner, you can share:
- Name and interests
- General preferences
- Activity suggestions

Do NOT share:
- Personal details (age, location, bio)
- Sensitive lifestyle information
- Specific personal facts

Be helpful but respectful of privacy.`;
```

## Summary

The system will:
1. Load Christine's full profile from database
2. Provide comprehensive context to AI
3. Allow AI to answer questions about Christine's interests and preferences
